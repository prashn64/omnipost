Omnipost
====================

### About

One of the ooh-ahh features that we usually don't notice on Facebook and Google+ is 
the box they use to let you post all different types of stuff in one fancy container.
The goal of this project is to create an open source, extensible multi-media post box
that can be dropped in to any website.
